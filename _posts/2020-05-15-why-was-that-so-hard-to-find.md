title: "Why was that so hard to find"
summary: "Pushing updates from external code into React components turned out to be easy with hooks — once I finally worked out how useEffect fits in."

In the interest of learning something new and filling in my time during the lockdown, I have been building my first react application. I recently been moving to use hooks and adding test coverage. For the most part I have found it easy to write the code, maintain sensible object boundries, and find help online when needed. However the documentation for to update data from external processes was unclear and for the most part non-existant.

I’m not sure if this is due to me being new to React and everyone just knows how to do this, or (and this seems unlikley) the only people who write react blogs are actually those who are building a tasks list application and so don’t need this functionality. What I will say is that once you understand how to use the hooks to pull data in it is actually extremely easy, which again makes me ask why this isn’t covered more widely.

So how did I do it:

### Create a component to track interest in updates and poll the backend for updates:

```javascript
let cardsByStack = {};
let watchers = {};

// allow registering to receive updates
export const watch = (stackId, watchMethod) => {
  watchers[stackId] = watchers[stackId] || [];
  watchers[stackId].push(watchMethod);

  watchMethod(cardsByStack[stackId]);
}

// allow deregistering to receive updates
export const unWatch = (stackId, watchMethod) => {
  watchers[stackId] = watchers[stackId].filter(watcher => watcher !== watchMethod);
}

// do an update
export const pollForAddedCards = () => {
  let stack_id, cards = ...

  cardsByStack[stack_id].push(card);

  watchers[stackId].forEach(watchMethod => watchMethod(cards[stackId]));
}

setInterval(pollForAddedCards, 1000)
```

### Registor interest in update, with the ability to update the local state:

```sql
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import {addEvent, updateCard, watch, unWatch} from '../state/CardState';

const CardStack = (props) => {
  const [cards, setCards] = useState();

  ....

  useEffect(() => {
    let watchCallback = (cards) => { setCards(cards) }

    watch(props.stackId, watchCallback)
    return () => { unWatch(props.stackId, watchCallback) }
  });
}
```

So how does this all work….

`useEffect` is the important thing here. Calling it without a second property means the code inside is run when the component loads/unloads, this allows me to pass the state modifier funtion `setCard` into the non React view hierarchy part of my application (called CardState here), where it can be called (and trigger view updates) asyncronously. Once you have understoof this, it is quite easy to receive updates from external sources.

**WARNING:** This is demonstrating how you trigger render updates from external parts of your code - i.e. using setTimeout to poll the server for updates from other players - with just react hooks. This is done by using module variable to store what is essentially global state, and while this works I would recommend against it for anything that have more than 1 global state. You are instead better off using one of the existing libraries like: * redux * reactn * recoil
